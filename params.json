My journey started when one day I discovered a new degree at the Jaume I University, they came to my town and presented it, and since I was deciding where to study and I always loved playing games with my friends, I decided to study it. Once the semester started, it was a strange feeling, as I didn't know a single thing about game development, but I started to feel curiosity and started reading everything I could find about the subject. Finally, after 4 years of hard work, I ended my degree having special interest in programming.\r\n\r\nHere you'll find some of the projects I made during my studies, as well as other independent projects.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Projects\r\n## Paintball: The Game (Final Degree Project)\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/8Vt8XE6.png)\r\nTrailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYa330V6N44\r\n\r\nGameplay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEkMvLffe08\r\n\r\n*Paintball: The Game* is a multiplayer online first person shooter inspired by the sport also known as Paintball.
