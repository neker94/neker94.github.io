<p>Hi! My name is Borja and i'm a graduated in Design and Development of Videogames. My journey started when one day I discovered a new degree at the Jaume I University, they came to my town and presented it, and since I was deciding where to study and I always loved playing games with my friends, I decided to study it. Once the semester started, it was a strange feeling, as I didn't know a single thing about game development, but I started to feel curiosity and started reading everything I could find about the subject. Finally, after 4 years of hard work, I ended my degree having special interest in programming.</p>

<p>Here you'll find some of the projects I made during my studies, as well as other independent projects.</p>

HIVE is a multiplayer online side-scrolling sci-fi shooter where two teams up to 10 players fight on HIVE's planet core. The battle is set on an hexagonal shaped map splitted into 6 different zones, each one with its own gravity direction. You can play heroes of different races and equip them with weapons and abilities of your choice to fit your favourite game style and combine with the rest of the team to reach the most competitive set. </p>
